**DISCLAIMER:** ORIGINAL PROJECT CREATION WAS NOT ORGANIZED THROUGH GITHUB*

A Dragon's Castle is a single player, user-driven game consisting of an adventurous storyline with multiple tasks the user must complete to continue through the story. A player must win two of the challenges we've included in order to progress through the main story of the adventure. In the end, they must defeat a ferocious fire-breathing dragon that has created chaos and turmoil in the player's town.

**TIC TAC TOE**

The Tic Tac Toe/Bingo minigame challenge was created by Juhi. This minigame consists of the basic ‘Tic Tac Toe’ strategies where two players play against each other to ultimately get three of their X's or O's in a row, column, or diagonal pattern. The player plays against the computer that was created with a random number generator to determine its placing on the board. This functionality is altered in our story to make it so the Tic Tac Toe board is actually a lock that is to be "solved" in order for the player to progress. The Tic Tac Toe or "Bingo" class, for short, has its personal functions and tools for its workability. (Text-based + SDL graphics)

**HANGMAN**

The Hangman minigame challenge was created by Raju. Just like regular hangman, the user is provided with a certain number of blanks associated with the number of letters in a mystery word. The user must guess the letters correctly without guessing too many or else they will have run out of guesses. In our game, we changed the way the player "loses" Hangman. Instead of having a man being hung throughout the guessing game, we have a closed scroll that, when the correct word is guessed, will open to reveal where the player's next locaiton must be. If the user reaches their guess limit, the player loses and has to start the game again. (Text-based + SDL graphics)

**MAIN GAMEPLAY**

Faith organized the game mechanics / main gameplay. The minigame classes were combined to be managed under the main program of the game. The main program consists of all of the game "events" that take place differently based on the user's choices. The transitions based on the user's choices were also managed here along with the functions making up the SDL / game's "utilities". This was implemented along with the storyline and graphics for the game. She also put together the bitmap art for the game and incorporated these scenes into the main program with SDL. Throughout the game the user is given lines of text narrating different parts of the story or giving directions, prompted to "Press enter to continue".

**CHALLENGES**

The graphics and transitions in the game were probably some of the more difficult tasks. We went back and forth between trying to make animation or images work for the game before our deadline. In the end, we ended up sticking to images to show up whenever the user completed certain tasks in the game and the transitions were optimized to make the game run much more smoothly.

**FUTURE AMBITIONS**

We want to increase the number of potental story paths by having more decision based events occur. We would also like to have the player choose an avatar at the beginning of the game in order to customize the art that shows up along the journey. Lastly, we would like to implement the game's graphics into most of the game (including the narrating parts) to make the game interface completely made up of SDL graphics.
